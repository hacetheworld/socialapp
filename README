# My Social Media clone app Using MERN STACK (Nodejs, Express, ReactJs, MongoDB, RestApi)

This is first version of web app that is finished i am currently working on to put it live... stay tune for that :)

Hopefullly in the future i will add some more features and refactor the code but my goal was to finish a project from start to finish and get familiar with the process of full stack web development.

and I would like to thank EDRoh(https://github.com/ed-roh) for this amazing course and explaintion..
